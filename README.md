My name is Clariza Look and I am currently a microsoft learn student ambassador. I am coming from a non-IT background for my previous work experience and decided to break into the technology space. I now work as a DevOps Data Engineer at Education Horizons Australia (which is an EdTech Company). Currently, I am a graduating student from the University of Western Australia taking Master of Information Technology.
