**clariza-look-microsoft-ambassador/clariza-look-microsoft-ambassador** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

My name is Clariza Look and I am currently a microsoft learn student ambassador. I am coming from a non-IT background for my previous work experience and decided to break into the technology space. I now work as a DevOps Data Engineer at Education Horizons Australia (which is an EdTech Company). Currently, I am a graduating student from the University of Western Australia taking Master of Information Technology.

- ðŸ”­ Previous work experience is from a non-IT background and decided to break into the technology space

- ðŸ‘¯ I passed both Azure Fundamentals and Azure AI Fundamentals Certifications  

## Technical Certifications

These are my current Microsoft Certifications.  Check out my training notes in my Certification Repositories. I'm not sure what I'm doing next, just need to find some time to focus and study!
